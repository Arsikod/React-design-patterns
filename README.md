## Layout Components

Components that deal primarily with arranging other components on the page. Ex: SplitScreen, List, Modal

**idea:** Components should not know where they're being displayed.

## Container Components

Components that take care of loading and managing data for their child components

**idea:** Components should not know where their data is coming from.
